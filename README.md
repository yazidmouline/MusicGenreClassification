# Music Genre Classification

This repository contains a Machine Learning project carried out by Yazid Mouline and Guillaume Requena during our Master's Engineering Degree second year at Eurecom with Télécom Paris.


Music streaming platforms such as Spotify or Deezer have totally modified the way we listen to music today. Instead of always listening to albums we tend to listen to playlists of songs grouped by genre.
